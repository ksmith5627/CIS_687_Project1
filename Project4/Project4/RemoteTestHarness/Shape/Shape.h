// Filename		: Shape.h
// Summary		: Defines an abstract class for a shape. 
// Description	: This is an abstract class for a shape. It's implemented by another class, 
//				  Hexagon, that is then used by TestDriver to test against. It's also referenced
//				  by the TestDriver so it has an idea of the interface that it's calling, without
//				  worrying about the implementation.
